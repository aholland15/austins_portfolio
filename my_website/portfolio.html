<p> When I was first introduced to this project I was given the option to create story or a game and 
I decided to create a story of my life and allowing the users to control the decisions of my life. 
I chose to do a story because since I was a young kid I have had goals set for myself so I tried to 
incorporate the goals into this story. I chose to put Mr. Engstrom in my story since he has had
helped me chose the decisions I have made throughout my hgihschool career because he was the real 
reason I am leaning towards pursuing engineerng in the future. How this story works is you will start
at a title page with the mine and my parteners name, a picture of my face which is your character, and 
a button to begin the story. Once you begin you will be told the story line and the instructions 
on how to move and make decisons. While making the first decision you have the option to get advice, you 
can then make the firs decsion, once that is made the backdrop will change and depending on what decsion you 
make determins what backdrop you are on next. If you make the correct decisions you will end u at the beach 
living a good life and can then press the space bar and money will fall from the top of the screen, if 
you make a wrong decision then you will end up working at mcdonalds for the rest of your life. Once you're done
you then finish by clicking the green button in the top corner. All around this
