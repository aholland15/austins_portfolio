<h1><center><p> Reflection </p></center></h1>
<h2><center><p> When I was first introduced to this project I was given the option to create story or a game and 
I decided to create a story of my life and allowing the users to control the decisions of my life. 
I chose to do a story because since I was a young kid I have had goals set for myself so I tried to 
incorporate the goals into this story. I chose to put Mr. Engstrom in my story since he has
helped me choose the decisions I have made throughout my highschool career and he introduced me to engineering and 
actually made me believe I can pursue engineering in the future.</h>
<br>
<br>
<h2>How this story works is you will startat a title page with the title of the story, mine and my parteners name, 
a picture of my face which is your character, and 
a button to begin the story. Once you begin you will be told the story line and the instructions 
on how to move and make decisons. While making the first decision you have the option to get advice, you 
can then make the first decsion, once that is made the backdrop will change and depending on what decsion you 
make determines what backdrop you go to next. If you make the correct decisions you will end up at the beach 
living a good life and can then press the space bar and money will fall from the top of the screen, if 
you make a wrong decision then you will end up working at mcdonalds for the rest of your life. Once you're done
you then finish by clicking the green button in the top corner.</h2>

<h2>All around this project was a great learning 
experience and allowed me to practice coding with scratch and also helped me learn about more detailed topics 
such as algorithms and abstractions. In this case the algorithm and abstraction are the same piece 
of code. The algorithm and abstraction in my story are the user controls that allows for the user or 
player to move the directional arrows to guide the character to make the decisions. This is considered 
the algorithm because it allows the sprite to move up, down, and side-to-side with 
one loop of code, this code is used throughtout the entire story when the user has to 
move the sprite and by using this algorithm in a forever loop, it makes the code so much simpler. This piece of code can also
be considered the abstraction because I used all of the user controls in one forever loop which allowed the code to be very 
simple and it is used throughout the entire story when the sprite has to move.</h2>

<h2>The two major difficulties we had was making it so once the space bar is pressed the money will fall on background
four (at the beach), and the other one was making sure the correct backdrop appeared when each specific decision was made. 
One of the most useful things I learned while creating this story has to be using the "say" text boxes because it was very 
helpful when including the instructions to the story, and also letting the user know the story line as the story continues. At first I 
was including the story line just by using the txt on each backdrop which made every one of the backdrops look very cluttered, unorganized, and 
in some spots, too hard to read.
<br>
<br>
If I had to do the story over again I do not think I would change very much of the story line, but I would try
and make it more appealing to the users, allow for the user to be more involved and making more detailed decisions, maybe even some decisions that affects 
other decisions, and then including character select. Character select is the main feature I regret not applying to this story. This project was an overall
great experience and taught me alot including taking every sprint seriously, managing my time properly, and even communication skills either with my teacher, fellow 
classmates, and even my partner. </p></center></h2>

<h1><p><center> Image Manipulation Project </p></center></h1>

<p><center> Original Picture and Manipulated Picture </p></center>
<center><img src="images/code_dog.png" height="300"></center>
<br>
<h2><p><center> During this project my partner and I came up with this code using the tutorial provided, other online sources, and 
our own basic python knowledge to create this image manipulation code. In this case, our code takes a photo that we have updated into our PIL image
library and imports it to the program along with set preprogrammed filters, it splits the RGB color coordinants to then only provide the red portion of RGB 
which allows the image to appear pink/red. The code then rotates the image 180 degrees and gives it a slight preprogrammed blur effect. It will then show you 
the original image, the manipulated image, and save the new image as a seperate file to your set directory.</center><p/>

<p><center>During this project my partner and I learned there are endless possibilities you can do to images using python. You can do something as simple
as turning the picture to greyscale all the way to changing each pixel in the image to a different color of you wanted too. We also learned that there 
are preprogrammed features inside python that do many different things for example the filter we used to blur the image. </center></p></h2>

<h1><p><center> Malware Presentation </p></center></h1>
<center><img src="images/Ping-Title.PNG" height="300"> <img src="images/Ping-How.PNG" height="300"></center>
<h2><p><center> My partner Jose and I decided to do our malware presentation on the Ping Of Death. The ping of death is simply 
multiple computers working simultaniously to infect a single computer with a virus/ overload onto the computer 
kicking the user offline, making it difficult for one to get back online. Ping Of Death was 
popular while playing videogames, when playing online a hacker could "Ping" you to death kicking
you offline although they are not near you. Online Websites can also be vulnerable to the "POD" attack 
taking their servers offline. Ways to prevent this attack is firewall downloads and certain routers
are used to prevent this attack along with many others.This presentation along with the rest of the classes presentations
increased my knowledge greatly on malware and viruses, before these presentation I knew what they were, 
but I had no clue how they functioned. </center></p></h2>

<h1><p><center> Automobile Thefts (Big Data) </p></center></h1>
<center><img src="images/Big-Data.PNG" height="300"></center>
<h2><p><center> Big data is important to comprehend because it is used to better understand
customers and their behaviors and preferences. With this Big Data project, my partner and I took a big data set of crimes. We chose to focus on 
automobile thefts from a chart that showed statistics for almost every crime in the US. We decided to do our chart soley 
based off of the reported automobile thefts. Based off of the data we created a chart to represent the data in Microsoft Excel. The data and chart shows 
the reported car thefts from the year 2000 to 2013 and that it has significantly decreased from about 
1.2 million thefts to roughly 700,000. This small project helped me obtain large amounts of data, narrow it down 
to what exactly I want to focus on, and taker that data and represent it with a chart. </p></center></h2>

<h1><p><center> Big Data Presentation </p></center></h1>
<center><img src="images/Big-Data2.PNG" height="300"></center>
<h2><p><center> This Big Data presentation was to provide us with more knowledge on Big Data. I chose to do 
my presentation on the Robotic Driving Companion to show that abstractions are used every single day with data products. This 
robotic companion is used inside your car to tell you directions, faster routes, and also to keep conversation with you while driving. 
This companion is considered big data because of the variety of data it withholds. The companion's data includes streets, names of citys, GPS programming, 
a listening function, a response function, sentence structure, and many datasets that we are not informed about. There are abstractions used 
in this product because the robot functiuons, responses, and directs the user and most users have no clue how the companion works exactly. I learned that big
data is used everyday in simulations and data collection. The point of this presentation was to inform the class about 
a big data product and give them a better understanding of big data and how it is used in products we see everyday. </p></center>

<h1><p><center> Simulation Modification </p></center></h1>
<center><img src="images/Snip3.PNG" height="300"> <img src="images/Snip4.PNG" height="300"></center>
<h2><p><center> This simulation modification was intended to inform us about simulations and how they work to provide for real life situations. 
Simulations are used to replicate situations that are far too complicated and or expensive. The simulations give real time answers for the imitations created. The simulation 
we chose to modify as a group was taking the two colors (Blue and Green), which represents atoms, split in the middle, and alter the code to allow for there to be four colors (Green, Blue, Red, and Pink)
divided into four quadrants. The simulation was used to find max diffusion distance between atoms. Our modification was intended to simulate adding more atoms to see if it effected
the max distance each atom travels. This simulation was created on netlogo which is a simulation program. My partner and I learned what simulations are and that they are difficult 
to code/create, but they save money, time, and resources. Creating a simulation on the computer or on a smaller scale is much easier and more effective than doing the actual problem 
multiple times before it is successful. </p></center></h2>

<h1><p><center> CSS Stylesheet </center></p></h1>
<h2><p><center> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed within my website. A CSS stylesheet saves a lot of work and is used to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. The advantage for using a CSS 
Stylesheet is you do not have to introduce the color of text, font, or font-size on every line of code. Instead, labeling each line calls a defined featrure inside of your CSS.  </center></p></h2>
