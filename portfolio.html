<center><p> When I was first introduced to this project I was given the option to create story or a game and 
I decided to create a story of my life and allowing the users to control the decisions of my life. 
I chose to do a story because since I was a young kid I have had goals set for myself so I tried to 
incorporate the goals into this story. I chose to put Mr. Engstrom in my story since he has
helped me choose the decisions I have made throughout my highschool career and he introduced me to engineering and 
actually made me believe I can pursue engineering in the future. How this story works is you will start
at a title page with the title of the story, mine and my parteners name, a picture of my face which is your character, and 
a button to begin the story. Once you begin you will be told the story line and the instructions 
on how to move and make decisons. While making the first decision you have the option to get advice, you 
can then make the first decsion, once that is made the backdrop will change and depending on what decsion you 
make determines what backdrop you go to next. If you make the correct decisions you will end up at the beach 
living a good life and can then press the space bar and money will fall from the top of the screen, if 
you make a wrong decision then you will end up working at mcdonalds for the rest of your life. Once you're done
you then finish by clicking the green button in the top corner. All around this project was a great learning 
experience and allowed me to practice coding with scratch and also helped me learn about more detailed topics 
such as algorithms and abstractions. In this case the algorithm and abstraction are the same piece 
of code. The algorithm and abstraction in my story are the user controls that allows for the user or 
player to move the directional arrows to guide the character to make the decisions. This is considered 
the algorithm because it allows the sprite to move up, down, and side-to-side with 
one loop of code, this code is used throughtout the entire story when the user has to 
move the sprite and by using this algorithm in a forever loop, it makes the code so much simpler. This piece of code can also
be considered the abstraction because I used all of the user controls in one forever loop which allowed the code to be very 
simple and it is used throughout the entire story when the sprite has to move.
The two major difficulties we had was making it so once the space bar is pressed the money will fall on background
four (at the beach), and the other one was making sure the correct backdrop appeared when each specific decision was made. 
One of the most useful things I learned while creating this story has to be using the "say" text boxes because it was very 
helpful when including the instructions to the story, and also letting the user know the story line as the story continues. At first I 
was including the story line just by using the txt on each backdrop which made every one of the backdrops look very cluttered, unorganized, and 
in some spots, too hard to read. If I had to do the story over again I do not think I would change very much of the story line, but I would try
and make it more appealing to the users, allow for the user to be more involved and making more detailed decisions, maybe even some decisions that affects 
other decisions, and then including character select. Character select is the main feature I regret not applying to this story. This project was an overall
great experience and taught me alot including taking every sprint seriously, managing my time properly, and even communication skills either with my teacher, fellow 
classmates, and even my partner. </p></center>
