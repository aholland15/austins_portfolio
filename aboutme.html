<center><p><font size="5"><font face="Helvetica">Hi!! My name is Austin Holland, I am a senior at Don Lugo Highschool, I have attended Don Lugo all four years and love the school. Some things I like to do 
are play soccer and football which I do play for the school. My favorite things to do outside of school is to work on my car, buy and sell clothes and shoes to make some extra money. I also like to spend time with my 
closest friends, my girlfriend and my family. I really enjoy learning about new things that could benefit me in the future especially coding and learning how to create apps and websites, im really looking foward to a
great year in my computer science class so I can eventually create a website for my dads company and maybe even an app my dad and his friends have ideas for!</font></p></center>
