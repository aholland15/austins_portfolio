<h2><center><p>Austin Holland is a four-year LEAD student at Don Antonio Lugo Highschool. His most recent accomplishment that he is proud of is getting accepted into Cal Poly Pomona because he did not think going into his senior year that he would get accepted anywhere and would have to go to a JC first then transfer. Another accomplishment is maintaining above a 3.5 GPA throughout high school because he went through a handful of challenging classes and has doubted himself, but he followed through and kept A's and B's all four years. His final accomplishment that he is proud of is playing varsity soccer and football while in high school, being the captain of the soccer team for 3 years, MVP his sophomore year, and getting the award of first team all-league punter his senior year. 
He is also eager to graduate because he is going to visit an engineering firm during summer and hopefully get an internship lined up with that company.</p></center>

The most meaningful experience in his life as of today is route 91 because both of his parents were there right in the center of all the madness. He was sleeping at his grandma's house when it was happening and was awakened by a phone call asking if his parents are okay and was extremely confused what was going on. Calling his mom and hearing her cry was the scariest time of his life, but hearing her voice was the best feeling in this specific moment. He went to school the next day although his parents were still trapped in Las Vegas and his reasoning was "to get his mind off things". This is the most meaningful experience in his life because it taught him that everything can be gone within minutes and

once it is gone it will never be reversed. He now takes that into consideration with every experience in his life and lives life to the fullest and to the best of his ability.</p></center></h2>
